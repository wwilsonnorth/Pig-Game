# Pig Game
This application was built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

Game Rules:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- Enter score you wish to play to in the 'Final Score' box at the bottom (this can be changed mid-game).
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold' which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- A player will lose their ENTIRE score when they roll two 6's in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
